## 🔢 13. FLAMES Logic (Game Mechanics)

### Step 1: Name Input

User enters two names (e.g., Naren, Priya)

### Step 2: Remove Common Letters

- Count letters in both names
- Remove common characters (one match = one elimination)
- Total remaining letters = `X`

### Step 3: FLAMES Count

- FLAMES = [F, L, A, M, E, S]
- Start from first letter, count through the array **circularly** up to `X`
- Remove the letter where you land
- Repeat process with the new reduced FLAMES array and same count `X`
- Final letter remaining = Relationship result

## 🎯 Final Note

The Flames app **isn't about rushing features.**  
It’s about **recreating magic**, pixel by pixel, line by line.

Our motto:

> “If it doesn’t feel magical to you, it’s not ready for the world.”

Every animation, every glow, every word matters — because this is **OSLabs** — and **our creations set the standard.**
